There is one implementation-dependent function: FETCH-ARGLIST.  It
takes a symbol as input and returns the argument list of the function
named by that symbol.  Here it is defined to return NIl, so, the
arguments will be displayed as Arg-1, Arg-2, and so on.  Modify this
using your implementation's function which returns returns the
argument list.

After that, just load Dtrace.lisp using LOAD function.
